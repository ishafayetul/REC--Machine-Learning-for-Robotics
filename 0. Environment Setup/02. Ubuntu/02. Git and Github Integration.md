# Git & GitHub Integration in VS Code (Ubuntu)

This guide explains how to set up Git, connect GitHub, and use them inside Visual Studio Code on **Ubuntu**.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

1. **Ubuntu**  
   Any recent LTS version (e.g. 20.04, 22.04, 24.04) is fine.

2. **Git** (we will install it)

3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (we will install it)

4. **GitHub Account**  
   If you do not have one, create it here:  
   <https://github.com/>

---

## 2. Install and Verify Git on Ubuntu

### 2.1. Update Package List

Open **Terminal** (`Ctrl + Alt + T`) and run:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2.2. Install Git

```
sudo apt install git -y
```

### 2.3. Verify Git Installation

```
git --version
```

You should see output like:

```text
git version 2.x.x
```

If you see a version number, Git is installed correctly.

---

## 3. Configure Git (Name & Email)

Set your identity so your commits are correctly attributed.

In **Terminal**, run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Check the values:

```bash
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
```

---

## 4. Install Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu

You can install VS Code in multiple ways. Here is a common method using the **Microsoft repository**.

### 4.1. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install wget gpg -y
```

### 4.2. Add Microsoft GPG Key and Repository

```bash
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg > /dev/null
```

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list > /dev/null
```

### 4.3. Update and Install VS Code

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code -y
```

### 4.4. Launch VS Code

* From Terminal:

  ```bash
  code
  ```

* Or from the **Applications menu** → search for **Visual Studio Code**.

---

## 5. Open a Project Folder in VS Code

1. Create a project folder, e.g.:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Projects/my-project
   cd ~/Projects/my-project
   ```

2. Start VS Code from this folder:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

   or:

3. In VS Code, go to **File → Open Folder…**, select your folder, and click **OK**.

---

## 6. Enable Git Integration in VS Code

VS Code has built-in Git support.

1. In VS Code, go to **View → Appearance → Show Activity Bar** (if it’s not visible).
2. In the Activity Bar (left side), click the **Source Control** icon (branch-like icon).
3. If Git is installed correctly:

   * You will see a message like **“No source control providers registered”** when no repo is initialized.
   * Or options like **Initialize Repository** if it detects a folder.

If VS Code cannot find Git, make sure Git is installed and try restarting VS Code.

---

## 7. Sign In to GitHub from VS Code

VS Code can connect to GitHub to publish or clone repositories.

1. In VS Code, open the **Command Palette**:

   * Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type and select:

   * `GitHub: Sign in`
3. VS Code will open your browser and show a GitHub authorization page.
4. Log in (if needed) and authorize VS Code to access your GitHub account.
5. After authorization, return to VS Code.
   Check the **Accounts** icon in the bottom-left corner to confirm you’re signed in.

---

## 8. Create a New Git Repository in VS Code (Local)

If your project folder is **not yet** a Git repository:

1. Open your project folder in VS Code (`code .` from the folder or via **File → Open Folder…**).
2. Click the **Source Control** icon on the left.
3. Click **Initialize Repository**.

   * This runs `git init` in your folder.
4. You should now see **Changes** listed in the Source Control panel when you create or edit files.

---

## 9. First Commit from VS Code

1. Create a file, e.g. `README.md`.

2. Add some content and save the file.

3. Go to the **Source Control** panel.

4. Under **Changes**, you will see your new file.

5. Hover over the file and click the **+ (Stage Changes)** icon, or click **Stage All Changes** (plus icon in the header).

6. In the message box at the top of the Source Control panel, type a commit message, for example:

   ```text
   Initial commit
   ```

7. Click the **✔ (Commit)** button or press `Ctrl + Enter` in the message box.

Now your first commit is saved in your local Git repository.

---

## 10. Publish a Local Repository to GitHub (Create Remote Repo)

### 10.1. Using VS Code “Publish Branch”

1. Ensure you are **signed in to GitHub** in VS Code.
2. After making at least one commit, look at the **Status Bar** at the bottom. You might see **“Publish Branch”** or a **cloud icon**.
3. Click **Publish Branch**.
4. A dialog will appear:

   * Choose **Publish to GitHub**.
   * Enter a repository name (or accept the suggested one).
   * Choose visibility: **Public** or **Private**.
5. Click **Publish**.

VS Code will:

* Create a new repository on your GitHub account.
* Push your local commits to GitHub.
* Set the remote origin automatically.

### 10.2. Verify on GitHub

1. Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).
2. Open your profile → **Your repositories**.
3. You should see the new repository with your project files.

---

## 11. Clone an Existing GitHub Repository in VS Code

If you already have a repository on GitHub and want to work on it in VS Code:

### 11.1. Get the Clone URL from GitHub

1. Go to your repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the **Code** (green) button.
3. Copy the **HTTPS** URL (e.g. `https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`).

### 11.2. Clone from VS Code

1. In VS Code, open the **Command Palette**: `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type and select: **`Git: Clone`**.
3. Paste the GitHub repository URL.
4. Choose a folder on your Ubuntu system where the repo will be cloned, e.g. `~/Projects`.
5. Wait for cloning to finish.
6. VS Code will ask: **“Open cloned repository?”**
   Click **Open**.

Now your cloned project is open and ready in VS Code with full Git integration.
